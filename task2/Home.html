        Flowers, also known as blossoms and blooms, are the reproductive structures of flowering plants. <br>Typically, they are structured in four circular levels around the end of a stalk. <br> These include: sepals, which are modified leaves that support the flower; petals, often designed to attract pollinators; male stamens, where pollen is presented; and female gynoecia. <br> where pollen is received and its movement is facilitated to the egg. <br> When flowers are arranged in a group, they are known collectively as an inflorescence.
